Day9 - Dictionary

Today, I learned about dictionary 

**What is Dictionary**:
Dictionary in Python finctions similarly to dictionary in real life. It is a data structure that allows the key value pairs of data together.

For example:
```
colors = {
    "apple": "green",
    "orange": "yellow",
    "coconut": "white"
}
```

OR

```
student = {
    "name": "Jose",
    "age": 26,
    "dream_job": "Backend developer",
    "nationality": "Nigeria"
}
```

**And to create an empty dictionary**:
```
student = {}
print(type(student))
```
**To add data to an empty dictionary**:
```
student = {}
student["name"] = "Ayobami"
print(student)
```


**To assign new value to a dictionary**:
```
student["name"] = "Landon"
print(student)
```

**List as the value pair**:
```
travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris", "Lillie", "Dijon"],
    "Germany": ["Berlin", "Valencia"]
}


print(travel_log["France"]) # output ["Paris", "Lillie", "Dijon"]
```
